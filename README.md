# HI_galaxy_pair
This table includes 1652 H\,{\sc i} detected galaxy pairs. The columns show (1) the ID of matched galaxy in galaxy pairs; (2) H\,{\sc i} ID in FASHI catalog; (3) R.A. of H\,{\sc i} in degrees; (4) Decl. of H\,{\sc i} in degrees; (5) Mass ratio of galaxy pair; (6) projected separation of galaxy pairs in $h^{-1}\mathrm{kpc}$; (7) Stellar mass of galaxy from the MPA-JHU Catalog; (8) SFR from the MPA-JHU Catalog; (9) redshift of galaxy pair; (10) Velocity width of the H\,{\sc i} line profile in $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ from FASHI catalog, measured at $50\%$ level of every peak by busy-function fitting; (11) Integrated H\,{\sc i} line flux density in $\mathrm{mJy\ km\ s^{-1}}$ by busy-function fitting from FASHI catalog; (12) H\,{\sc i} mass calculated via Equation \ref{eq:h1mass} from FASHI catalog; (13) redshift of H\,{\sc i} from FASHI catalog.
